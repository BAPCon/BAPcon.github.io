            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to analyze the bias and sentiment of YouTube comments on the podcast 
                <strong>Ukraine: the Latest</strong> hosted by the Telegraph. Leveraging labeled training data, 
                we fine-tuned a Gemini model to classify comments with an accuracy of approximately 85%. 
                The training data comprised 2,000 manually labeled comments.

            <p>
                Our findings reveal a substantial pro-Russian bias among the comments, contrasting with the 
                widely accepted sentiment in most countries. According to a research study by Pew, 
                only about 10% of people in the West have a positive opinion of Russia.
